            some things about me are that i like music, soccer and i like to bike with my friends. i got into soccer when i was 10 ever sense i made it my life and career ,i hope to one day play in a professinal team. Music has also been a big part of my life because it helps me relax This also goes with biking because when i go out with my friends we laugh and have a great time.
